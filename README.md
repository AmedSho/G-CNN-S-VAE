# Group Equivariant CNN and disentangling β-VAE

In this repository I'd like to post the work I have done for the final project of the course DLAI held by prof. Rodolà at Sapienza University of Rome.
The idea is really simple and straightforward, I obtained disentangling rotational property by replacing the encoder of a VAE with a Group Convolutional NN. This fancy sketch should explain better the main architecture:
