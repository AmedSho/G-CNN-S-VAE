# Group Equivariant CNN and disentangling β-VAE

Lot of work has been done these years for the development of group equivariant neural networks, both in the direction of discrete symmetry groups and continuous symmetry groups. Once verified the main properties of group equivariant CNNs and confirmed his performace, in this work I’d like to show a potential use of a G-CNN as a dis- entagling agent for a hyperspherical β-VAE.
