# Disentangling β-VAE using a Group Equivariant CNN Encoder

In this repository I'd like to post the work I have done for the final project of the course DLAI held by prof. Rodolà at Sapienza University of Rome.
The idea is really simple and straightforward, I obtained disentangling rotational property by replacing the encoder of a VAE with a Group Convolutional NN. This fancy sketch should explain better the main architecture:

In the repository there is a folder with the project and the entire code I used for the project, which can be also easly found here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/amedsho/s-gcnn-vae

VAE response under 360 degree rotation of the input:
